# TSP-Simulated-Annealing-Py
Solution to the travelling salesmen problem using the simulated annealing algorithm 

In this project the simulated annealing algorithm is used to identify the shortest path to visit a selected number of cities in the US. 
A a file named 'Capitals' containts 30 cities in the US which is also shown on the 'map' image. 
The algorithm takes all cities and tries to solve the problem for the shortest path and presents the route on the map provided.
